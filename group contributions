What we all did:

We set up a git repository for all of us to contribute to. We had a todo document where we divided up individual parts of the assignment.

Each person took primary responsibility for certain aspects of the project as follows, but we also helped out with other aspects as necessary and if someone had more time.  Updating the requirements and design document was also distributed. Everyone had the task of use-testing the UI and trying to break it and find problems.
David Akodes: file input and string processing
Julia Ebert: user interface
Matthew Taylor: testing
Jimmy Ly: other methods of MyGradeBook
