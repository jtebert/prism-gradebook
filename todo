TODO:

- Add checking equality of GradeBooks
- Add toString() method

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> ui package <-

PRISM
has access to stuff in Extension class (because same package)

Extension
extends MyGradeBook

----------------------------------

-> gradebook package <-

MyGradeBook
has protected ArrayList methods

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIVISION OF LABOR:

- updated design/requirements document? (after/on Sunday)

Matthew:
-----------
-black box testing
public void addStudent [requires sorting]
public void removeStudent(Student student)
public void addAssignment(String assignmentName, Double totalPoints, Double percent)
public void removeAssignment(assignment)

Jimmy:
-----------
- UML
- gradebook processing/output methods (+ whitebox tests)
-> Can you add errors to stuf like max that will occur if, say, assignment doesn't exist? (JE)
public boolean changeGrade(String assignmentName, String username, double newGrade)
public double average(String assignmentName)
public double median(String assignmentName)
public double min(String assignmentName)
public double max(String assignmentName)
public double currentGrade(String username)
public HashMap<String, Double> currentGrades()
public double assignmentGrade(String assignmentName,
            String username)
-> Make sure this throws errors if assignmentName or username not found
public String outputCurrentGrades()
public String outputStudentGrades(String username)
public String outputAssignmentGrades(String assignName)
public String outputGradebook()
-> Where you use Set in various places doesn't work - Set is just an interface.
   I'm not sure what concrete subclass it makes the most sense to use, or if possible
   to convert to ArrayList (JE)

David:
-----------
- processing/initializing methods  (+ whitebox tests)
  processString, processFile, initialize methods
-> Could you also add functions specifically for addStudents, addAssignments
   that add students/assignments from a file? I made a method for adding a single student,
   but the specs call for being able to add students from a file. Make throw an error if 
   file doesn't exist. (JE)
   Also addAssignmentGrades and addStudent grades (for adding grades from files - see specs
   in the assignment page)

public static MyGradeBook initialize()
public static MyGradeBook initializeWithFile(String filename)
public static MyGradeBook initializeWithString(String startingString)
public void processFile(String filename)
public void processString(String additionalString)
 - Look at the header & figure out what to do
 - helper functions for processing each options (assignment, students, etc)

Julia:
-----------
- UI
- GradeBook ArrayList functions
- readme
